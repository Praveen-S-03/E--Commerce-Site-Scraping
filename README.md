# 🛒 E-Commerce Site Scraping

A lightweight Python project for scraping product data from e-commerce websites. This repository provides scripts and helpers to fetch product listings, extract structured information (title, price, rating, availability, URL, etc.), and save results in common formats like CSV and JSON.


## 🌟 Features

- Modular scraping scripts for collecting product listings and pages
- Parsers for common product fields:
- Title, Price, Description, URL
- Save results to CSV and JSON formats
- Rate limiting and polite request patterns to avoid overloading sites
- Simple CLI examples for common scraping tasks
- Guidance for adding new site scrapers

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- selenium web driver
- requests
- beautifulsoup4
- lxml
-pandas (optional — for CSV/JSON export)

## Install Dependencies 
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Selenium Setup

For JavaScript-heavy sites, install a compatible browser driver:

# Example: ChromeDriver on macOS (Homebrew)
brew install --cask chromedriver

# Or download manually:
# https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/
```
## 🚀 Quickstart / Usage
CLI Example
```
Scraping 2 pages for "laptop" and saving to CSV:

python scrape.py \
  --site example-store \
  --query "laptop" \
  --pages 2 \
  --output results.csv
```


## 💾 Output Formats

- CSV — for spreadsheets and quick analysis
- JSON — structured data for downstream processing
- (Optional) SQLite/PostgreSQL — for larger datasets or persistent storage

## 🛠 Extending / Adding a Scraper

- Create a new module in scrapers/ (e.g., scrapers/newsite.py).
- Implement functions/classes to:
- Build search/listing URLs
- Fetch pages with headers and polite delays
- Parse listing pages to collect product URLs
- Parse product pages for structured fields
- Register the new scraper in the CLI runner.

## Tips:

- Prefer requests + BeautifulSoup for static pages
- Use Selenium for JavaScript-heavy pages
- Respect caching headers (ETag / Last-Modified) where possible
- Add unit tests for parsers when feasible

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Rotating proxies and rate limiters for large-scale scraping
- Saving directly to databases (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
- Jupyter notebooks demonstrating analysis of scraped data

## ⚖️ Responsible Scraping & Legal Considerations

- Obey robots.txt and site Terms of Service
- Avoid scraping paywalled or authenticated content without permission
- Use rate limiting, random delays, and custom User-Agent headers
- Consider contacting site owners for permission for large-scale scraping

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

- Blank or missing content → site relies on JavaScript → use Selenium
- HTTP 403/429 → slow down requests, retry/backoff, or use proxies (if allowed)
- HTML structure changes → update your CSS selectors/XPaths

## 📝 Issues

- If you encounter bugs or want new features:
- Open an issue with a description
- Include steps to reproduce and relevant error messages
